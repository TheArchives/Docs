# Welcome to the documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to The Archives' staff documentation and general handbook.
This set of documentation is designed to ease you into using the tools
at your disposal as a staffer, and to prepare any aspiring staffers
regarding what they can expect in whatever position they're aiming at.

If you're just looking to refer to a specific area of the community, you
may select it from the navigation bar at the top. Otherwise, read on.

## Ranks and expectations

A lot of people seem to believe that being a staff member is generally fun,
easy, and not time-consuming. Unfortunately, all of these assumptions are
wrong for the majority of cases.

* While we expect real life to take priority over the community, a lot of
  staffers decide to spend a majority of their free time on IRC, or on the
  Minecraft servers. Not every staffer does this, but simply being 
  available is a very helpful way to contribute to the community.
    * It's very hard to overestimate the importance of getting to know
      members of the community, particularly the more active ones - but
      this will happen naturally if you spend time around them.
* Sometimes, although not frequently, there are very tough decisions to make.
  Sometimes it's a tough call on a ban, sometimes it's an idea that someone
  suggested that you feel is inappropriate, or sometimes it's just down to
  plain human nature.
    * You will experience these things first-hand. As a new staffer, we may
      decide not to throw you in at the deep end, of course, but we all share
      the load of running the community, and it can be difficult and even quite
      stressful at times.
    * We do recommend that staffers take some time off if they feel themselves
      burning out or getting too stressed. While it can sometimes create work
      for other staffers, making decisions on the fly when you're in a bad mood
      can also be very bad for the community at large, so spending some time
      away may be just what the doctor ordered - for the best interests of not
      only the community, but also those of the individual staffer.
* Staff operates a somewhat open-forum approach towards ideas and decisions that
  have to be made. As a result, we often operate a simple vote based on whoever is
  around at the time - Sometimes, you may feel that the rest of the team is voting
  against you, but it's worth considering that there may be a good reason for not
  sharing your view. It's nothing personal, but it's something that can and does
  happen.

Of course, there are some positive sides to being a staff member as well.

* You get a hand in planning and the direction of the network - As a staff member,
  your ideas get heard first, directly in the places we would discuss them, and you
  can get instant feedback on them.
* The Archives prides itself in not being generic and trying to provide a personal
  experience for every regular member. This extends to staff members as well - we
  do try to look out for each other when appropriate. If there's a problem, raise
  it with another staffer. We'll be happy to help.
* You get to contribute to the community in many direct and active ways. You need
  complain about griefers and spammers no longer! Simply kick/ban them yourself
  in accordance with [the rules](https://archivesmc.com/rules).

Still here? Have I not scared you away yet? Excellent, keep on reading!

Most people know what our ranks are. Staff ranks do convey their own meanings, and
are carried over throughout most of the network, and as such different ranks are
expected to perform different tasks.

* **Moderators** are those staffers that get down and dirty with the players on a
  daily basis. They're expected to spend time ingame, keeping an eye on the chat
  and possibly doing a grief check every now and then, but otherwise they are
  pretty much free to just play the game. Additionally, they may be called upon
  to look after IRC or the forums, or for their opinions on various topics, but
  aren't expected to be the workhorses of the network.
    * Moderators will be **op** or **@** on IRC, they have access to the bots and
      will often be the ones to create bans, kicks, tempbans and mutes, as well as
      recommending users for build evaluations or rank-ups.
* **Admins** are all about the management. While they can (and do) perform the
  same tasks as moderators, they are given access to manage many aspects of the
  servers and are deeply involved with network planning and architecture, and
  generally working on the direction of the network. Admins work closely with the
  owners and moderators and aim to keep the network running smoothly and help
  with its growth.
    * Admins will be **admin**, also known as **protected** or **&** on IRC. 
      They will often perform administrative duties such as posting on the
      website, managing ranks ingame and on the forums, and working directly
      with the server consoles and files.
* **Owners** don't have a clear set of responsibilities. As the higest tier of
  staff, they do a variety of things and the things that they do are generally
  specific to the individual person.
    * Owners have the **channel owner** or **~** status on IRC.
